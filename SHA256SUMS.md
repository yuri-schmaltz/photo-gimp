# PhotoGIMP Checksums

This file contains SHA256 checksums for PhotoGIMP releases to verify download integrity.

## How to Verify

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Calculate checksum
Get-FileHash PhotoGIMP.zip -Algorithm SHA256

# Compare with the value below
```

### Linux/macOS
```bash
# Calculate and verify
sha256sum PhotoGIMP.zip
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```

## Release 3.0 (Current)

**Note:** These checksums should be generated by the release maintainer when creating official releases.

To generate checksums for a new release:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
sha256sum PhotoGIMP.zip PhotoGIMP-linux.zip photogimp.ico > SHA256SUMS

# Windows (PowerShell)
Get-FileHash PhotoGIMP.zip, PhotoGIMP-linux.zip, photogimp.ico -Algorithm SHA256 | 
  ForEach-Object { "$($_.Hash.ToLower())  $($_.Path | Split-Path -Leaf)" } | 
  Out-File -Encoding ASCII SHA256SUMS
```

## Why Verify Checksums?

Verifying checksums ensures:
- Your download was not corrupted during transfer
- The file has not been tampered with
- You have the exact file released by the PhotoGIMP team

**Always download PhotoGIMP from official sources:**
- GitHub Releases: https://github.com/Diolinux/PhotoGIMP/releases
- Official website (if available)

## Security Notice

If the checksum doesn't match:
- ❌ **DO NOT use the downloaded file**
- Download again from the official source
- If the problem persists, report it in GitHub Issues

## GPG Signatures (Future Enhancement)

For enhanced security, future releases may include GPG signatures. This would allow you to verify not just file integrity, but also authenticity (that it was actually released by the PhotoGIMP team).
